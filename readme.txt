Notification Enhancements for Semantic Linkbacks

== Description == 

Uses the pluggable functions of WordPress to replace the Comment Notification functions with ones
easier to adjust. The implementation is a patch currently under consideration for WordPress Core 
under Ticket #33735(https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33735).

It then adds to the filter to make the display aware contextual.
